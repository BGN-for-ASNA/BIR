\title{Samples from a right-truncated distribution.}
\usage{
bi.dist.right_truncated_distribution(
  base_dist,
  high = 0,
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_dist}{The base distribution to truncate. Must be a univariate distribution with real support.}

\item{mask}{An optional boolean vector to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector. When \code{sample=FALSE} (model building), this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When \code{sample=TRUE} (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{The number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{Logical. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI right-truncated distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the right-truncated distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
This distribution truncates the base distribution at a specified high value.  Values greater than `high` are discarded,
effectively creating a distribution that is only supported up to that point. This is useful for modeling data
where observations are only possible within a certain range.

\deqn{f(x) = \frac{f(x)}{P(X \le high)}}
