\title{Sample from a Categorical distribution.}
\usage{
bi.dist.categorical(
  probs = py_none(),
  logits = py_none(),
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{A numeric vector of probabilities for each category. Must sum to 1.}

\item{mask}{An optional boolean vector to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector specifying the shape. When \code{sample=FALSE} (model building),
this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape.
When \code{sample=TRUE} (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array
of the given shape.}

\item{event}{The number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{Logical; If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Categorical distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Categorical distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The Categorical distribution, also known as the multinomial distribution,
describes the probability of different outcomes from a finite set of possibilities.
It is commonly used to model discrete choices or classifications.

\deqn{P(k) = \frac{e^{\log(p_k)}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{\log(p_j)}}}

where :math:`p_k` is the probability of outcome :math:`k`, and the sum is over all possible outcomes.
