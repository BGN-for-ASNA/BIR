\title{Student's t-distribution.}
\usage{
bi.dist.student_t(
  df,
  loc = 0,
  scale = 1,
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A numeric vector representing degrees of freedom, must be positive.}

\item{loc}{A numeric vector representing the location parameter, defaults to 0.0.}

\item{scale}{A numeric vector representing the scale parameter, defaults to 1.0.}

\item{mask}{A logical vector to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector. When `sample=False` (model building), this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When `sample=True` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{Integer representing the number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{Logical. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site. This is essential for building complex distributions like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Student's t-distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Student's t-distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The Student's t-distribution is a probability distribution that arises in hypothesis testing involving the mean of a normally distributed population when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is similar to the normal distribution, but has heavier tails, making it more robust to outliers.
