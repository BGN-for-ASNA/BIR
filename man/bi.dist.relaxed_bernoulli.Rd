\title{Samples from a Relaxed Bernoulli distribution.}
\usage{
bi.dist.relaxed_bernoulli(
  temperature,
  probs = py_none(),
  logits = py_none(),
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{temperature}{A numeric value representing the temperature parameter.}

\item{mask}{A logical vector or array to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector (e.g., `c(10)`) specifying the shape. When `sample=False` (model building), this is used
with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When `sample=True` (direct sampling), this is
used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{An integer representing the number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.
This is essential for building complex distributions like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Relaxed Bernoulli distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Relaxed Bernoulli distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The Relaxed Bernoulli distribution is a continuous relaxation of the discrete Bernoulli distribution.
It's useful for variational inference and other applications where a differentiable approximation of the Bernoulli is needed.
The probability density function (PDF) is defined as:
\deqn{p(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \tanh\left(\frac{x - \beta \log(\frac{p}{1-p})}{1}\right) \right)}
