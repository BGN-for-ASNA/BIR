\title{Samples from a Multinomial distribution.}
\usage{
bi.dist.multinomial_probs(
  probs,
  total_count = 1,
  total_count_max = py_none(),
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{A numeric vector of probabilities for each outcome. Must sum to 1.}

\item{total_count}{The number of trials.}

\item{mask}{An optional boolean vector to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector. When `sample=False` (model building), this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When `sample=True` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{The number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{Logical. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site. This is essential for building complex distributions like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI MultinomialProbs distribution object (for model building).

   - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the MultinomialProbs distribution (for direct sampling).

   - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The Multinomial distribution models the number of times each of several discrete outcomes occurs in a fixed number of trials.  Each trial independently results in one of several outcomes, and each outcome has a probability of occurring.

\deqn{P(X = x) = \frac{n!}{x_1! x_2! \cdots x_k!} p_1^{x_1} p_2^{x_2} \cdots p_k^{x_k}}

where:

* \eqn{n} is the total number of trials.
* \eqn{x} is a vector of counts for each outcome.
* \eqn{p} is a vector of probabilities for each outcome.
