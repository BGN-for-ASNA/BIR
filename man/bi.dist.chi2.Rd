\title{Samples from a Chi-squared distribution.}
\usage{
bi.dist.chi2(
  df,
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A numeric vector representing the degrees of freedom. Must be positive.}

\item{validate_args}{Logical: Whether to validate parameter values.  Defaults to `reticulate::py_none()`.}

\item{name}{A character string representing the name of the random variable
within a model. This is used to uniquely identify the variable. Defaults to 'x'.}

\item{obs}{A numeric vector or array of observed values. If provided, the
random variable is conditioned on these values. If `NULL`, the variable is
treated as a latent (unobserved) variable. Defaults to `NULL`.}

\item{mask}{A logical vector, matrix, or array to mask observations.}

\item{sample}{A logical value that controls the function's behavior. If `TRUE`,
the function will directly draw samples from the distribution. If `FALSE`,
it will create a random variable within a model. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{seed}{An integer used to set the random seed for reproducibility when
`sample = TRUE`. This argument has no effect when `sample = FALSE`, as
randomness is handled by the model's inference engine. Defaults to 0.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector used for shaping. When `sample=FALSE` (model building),
this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape.
When `sample=TRUE` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array
of the given shape.}

\item{event}{An integer representing the number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event
dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object
instead of creating a sample site. This is essential for building complex distributions
like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Chi-squared distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Chi-squared distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).

\description{
The Chi-squared distribution is a continuous probability distribution that arises
frequently in hypothesis testing, particularly in ANOVA and chi-squared tests.
It is defined by a single positive parameter, degrees of freedom (df), which
determines the shape of the distribution.

\deqn{p(x; df) = \frac{1}{2^{df/2} \Gamma(df/2)} x^{df/2 - 1} e^{-x/2}}
