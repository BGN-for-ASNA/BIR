\usage{
bi.dist.truncated_cauchy(
  loc = 0,
  scale = 1,
  low = py_none(),
  high = py_none(),
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{loc}{Location parameter of the Cauchy distribution.}

\item{scale}{Scale parameter of the Cauchy distribution.}

\item{low}{(float, jnp.ndarray, optional): The lower truncation point. If `None`, the distribution is only truncated on the right. Defaults to `None`.}

\item{high}{(float, jnp.ndarray, optional): The upper truncation point. If `None`, the distribution is only truncated on the left. Defaults to `None`.
validate_args (bool, optional): Whether to enable validation of distribution parameters. Defaults to `None`.}

\item{validate_args}{Logical: Whether to validate parameter values.  Defaults to `reticulate::py_none()`.}

\item{name}{A character string representing the name of the random variable
within a model. This is used to uniquely identify the variable. Defaults to 'x'.}

\item{obs}{A numeric vector or array of observed values. If provided, the
random variable is conditioned on these values. If `NULL`, the variable is
treated as a latent (unobserved) variable. Defaults to `NULL`.}

\item{mask}{An optional boolean array to mask observations.}

\item{sample}{A logical value that controls the function's behavior. If `TRUE`,
the function will directly draw samples from the distribution. If `FALSE`,
it will create a random variable within a model. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{seed}{An integer used to set the random seed for reproducibility when
`sample = TRUE`. This argument has no effect when `sample = FALSE`, as
randomness is handled by the model's inference engine. Defaults to 0.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector. When `sample=False` (model building),
this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape.
When `sample=True` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{The number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{Logical; If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.
This is essential for building complex distributions like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Truncated Cauchy distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Truncated Cauchy distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).

\description{
Samples from a Truncated Cauchy distribution.

The Cauchy distribution, also known as the Lorentz distribution, is a continuous probability distribution
that appears frequently in various areas of mathematics and physics. It is characterized by its heavy tails,
which extend to infinity. The truncated version limits the support of the Cauchy distribution to a specified interval.
