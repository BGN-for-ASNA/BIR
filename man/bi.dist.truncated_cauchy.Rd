\title{Truncated Cauchy Distribution}
\usage{
bi.dist.truncated_cauchy(
  loc = 0,
  scale = 1,
  low = py_none(),
  high = py_none(),
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{loc}{Location parameter of the Cauchy distribution.}

\item{scale}{Scale parameter of the Cauchy distribution.}

\item{mask}{An optional boolean array to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector. When `sample=False` (model building),
this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape.
When `sample=True` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{The number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{Logical; If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.
This is essential for building complex distributions like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Truncated Cauchy distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Truncated Cauchy distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
Samples from a Truncated Cauchy distribution.

The Cauchy distribution, also known as the Lorentz distribution, is a continuous probability distribution
that appears frequently in various areas of mathematics and physics. It is characterized by its heavy tails,
which extend to infinity. The truncated version limits the support of the Cauchy distribution to a specified interval.
