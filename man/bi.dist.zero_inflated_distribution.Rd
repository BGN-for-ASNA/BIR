\usage{
bi.dist.zero_inflated_distribution(
  base_dist,
  gate = py_none(),
  gate_logits = py_none(),
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_dist}{Distribution: The base distribution to be zero-inflated (e.g., Poisson, NegativeBinomial).}

\item{gate}{numeric(1): Probability of extra zeros (between 0 and 1).}

\item{gate_logits}{numeric(1): Log-odds of extra zeros.}

\item{validate_args}{Logical: Whether to validate parameter values.  Defaults to `reticulate::py_none()`.}

\item{name}{A character string representing the name of the random variable
within a model. This is used to uniquely identify the variable. Defaults to 'x'.}

\item{obs}{A numeric vector or array of observed values. If provided, the
random variable is conditioned on these values. If `NULL`, the variable is
treated as a latent (unobserved) variable. Defaults to `NULL`.}

\item{mask}{logical(1): Optional boolean array to mask observations.}

\item{sample}{A logical value that controls the function's behavior. If `TRUE`,
the function will directly draw samples from the distribution. If `FALSE`,
it will create a random variable within a model. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{seed}{An integer used to set the random seed for reproducibility when
`sample = TRUE`. This argument has no effect when `sample = FALSE`, as
randomness is handled by the model's inference engine. Defaults to 0.}

\item{shape}{numeric(1): A multi-purpose argument for shaping. When `sample=False` (model building),
this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape.
When `sample=True` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw
JAX array of the given shape.  Provide as a numeric vector (e.g., `c(10)`).}

\item{event}{int(1): The number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{Logical: If True, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.
This is essential for building complex distributions like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Zero Inflated distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Zero Inflated distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).

\description{
A Zero-Inflated distribution combines a base distribution with a Bernoulli
distribution to model data with an excess of zero values. It assumes that each observation
is either drawn from the base distribution or is a zero with probability determined
by the Bernoulli distribution (the "gate"). This is useful for modeling data
where zeros are more frequent than expected under a single distribution,
often due to a different underlying process.

\deqn{P(x) = \pi \cdot I(x=0) + (1 - \pi) \cdot P_{base}(x)}

where:

- \eqn{P_{base}(x)} is the probability density function (PDF) or probability mass function (PMF) of the base distribution.

- \eqn{\pi} is the probability of generating a zero, governed by the Bernoulli gate.

- \eqn{I(x=0)} is an indicator function that equals 1 if x=0 and 0 otherwise.
