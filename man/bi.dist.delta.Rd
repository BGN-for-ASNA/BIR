\title{The Delta distribution.}
\usage{
bi.dist.delta(
  v = 0,
  log_density = 0,
  event_dim = 0,
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{A numeric vector representing the location of the point mass.}

\item{mask}{A boolean vector to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector used for shaping. When `sample=FALSE` (model building), this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When `sample=TRUE` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{The number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Delta distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Delta distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The Delta distribution, also known as a point mass distribution, assigns probability 1 to a single point and 0 elsewhere. It's useful for representing deterministic variables or as a building block for more complex distributions.
