\title{title  Install BayesInference Python Dependencies}
\usage{
BI_install(type = "cpu")
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{(character) The installation type. Must be either `'cpu'` (default)
for a CPU-only installation or `'gpu'` for a CUDA-enabled GPU installation.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `NULL`. The function is called for its side effects.
}
\description{
Creates a dedicated Python virtual environment and installs the
`BayesInference` Python package and its required dependencies (like `numpyro`
and `jax`). It is essential to run this function once before using the package.
}
\details{
This function automates the setup process by:
1. Creating a clean, isolated Python virtual environment named
   `r-bayes-inference-cpu` or `r-bayes-inference-gpu`.
2. Installing the correct version of the `BayesInference` Python package
   from PyPI using `pip`.

You must restart your R session after installation for the changes to take
effect.
