\title{Samples from an Exponential distribution.}
\usage{
bi.dist.exponential(
  rate = 1,
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{A numeric vector, matrix, or array representing the rate parameter, \eqn{`\lambda`}. Must be positive.}

\item{mask}{An optional boolean vector to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector used to shape the distribution. When `sample=False` (model building), this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When `sample=True` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{An integer representing the number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site. This is essential for building complex distributions like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Exponential distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Exponential distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The Exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models the time until an event occurs in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is often used to model the duration of events, such as the time until a machine fails or the length of a phone call.
