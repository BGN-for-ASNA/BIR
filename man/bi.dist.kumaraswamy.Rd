\usage{
bi.dist.kumaraswamy(
  concentration1,
  concentration0,
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{concentration1}{A numeric vector, matrix, or array representing the first shape parameter. Must be positive.}

\item{concentration0}{A numeric vector, matrix, or array representing the second shape parameter. Must be positive.}

\item{validate_args}{Logical: Whether to validate parameter values.  Defaults to `reticulate::py_none()`.}

\item{name}{A character string representing the name of the random variable
within a model. This is used to uniquely identify the variable. Defaults to 'x'.}

\item{obs}{A numeric vector or array of observed values. If provided, the
random variable is conditioned on these values. If `NULL`, the variable is
treated as a latent (unobserved) variable. Defaults to `NULL`.}

\item{mask}{A logical vector, matrix, or array. Optional boolean array to mask observations.}

\item{sample}{A logical value that controls the function's behavior. If `TRUE`,
the function will directly draw samples from the distribution. If `FALSE`,
it will create a random variable within a model. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{seed}{An integer used to set the random seed for reproducibility when
`sample = TRUE`. This argument has no effect when `sample = FALSE`, as
randomness is handled by the model's inference engine. Defaults to 0.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector. When \code{sample=FALSE} (model building), this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape.
When \code{sample=TRUE} (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{An integer representing the number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.
This is essential for building complex distributions like `MixtureSameFamily`.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}: A BI Kumaraswamy distribution object (for model building).

   - When \code{sample=TRUE}: A JAX array of samples drawn from the Kumaraswamy distribution (for direct sampling).

   - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}: The raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The Kumaraswamy distribution is a continuous probability distribution defined on the interval [0, 1].
It is a flexible distribution that can take on various shapes depending on its parameters.

\deqn{f(x; a, b) = a b x^{a b - 1} (1 - x)^{b - 1}}
