\usage{
bi.dist.poisson(
  rate,
  is_sparse = FALSE,
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{A numeric vector representing the average number of events.}

\item{mask}{A logical vector to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector used for shaping. When `sample=False` (model building), this is used with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When `sample=True` (direct sampling), this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{An integer representing the number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}, a BI Poisson distribution object (for model building).

 - When \code{sample=TRUE}, a JAX array of samples drawn from the Poisson distribution (for direct sampling).

 - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}, the raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).

\description{
A discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event.
Creates a Poisson distribution, a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event.
