\title{Samples from an LKJ (Lewandowski, Kurowicka, Joe) distribution for correlation matrices.}
\usage{
bi.dist.lkj(
  dimension,
  concentration = 1,
  sample_method = "onion",
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = py_none(),
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE,
  to_jax = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dimension}{An integer representing the dimension of the correlation matrices.}

\item{concentration}{A numeric vector representing the concentration/shape parameter of the distribution (often referred to as eta). Must be positive.}

\item{sample_method}{(str): Either "cvine" or "onion". Methods proposed offer the same distribution over correlation matrices. But they are different in how to generate samples. Defaults to "onion".}

\item{validate_args}{Logical: Whether to validate parameter values.  Defaults to `reticulate::py_none()`.}

\item{name}{A character string representing the name of the random variable
within a model. This is used to uniquely identify the variable. Defaults to 'x'.}

\item{obs}{A numeric vector or array of observed values. If provided, the
random variable is conditioned on these values. If `NULL`, the variable is
treated as a latent (unobserved) variable. Defaults to `NULL`.}

\item{mask}{An optional boolean vector to mask observations.}

\item{sample}{A logical value that controls the function's behavior. If `TRUE`,
the function will directly draw samples from the distribution. If `FALSE`,
it will create a random variable within a model. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{seed}{An integer used to set the random seed for reproducibility when
`sample = TRUE`. This argument has no effect when `sample = FALSE`, as
randomness is handled by the model's inference engine. Defaults to 0.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector used for shaping. When `sample=False` (model building), this is used
with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When `sample=True` (direct sampling),
this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{An integer representing the number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.}

\item{to_jax}{Boolean. Indicates whether to return a JAX array or not.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}: A BI LKJ distribution object (for model building).

   - When \code{sample=TRUE}: A JAX array of samples drawn from the LKJ distribution (for direct sampling).

   - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}: The raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The LKJ distribution is controlled by the concentration parameter \deqn{\eta} to make the probability
of the correlation matrix M proportional to \deqn{\det(M)^{\eta - 1}}. When \deqn{\eta = 1},
the distribution is uniform over correlation matrices.  When \deqn{\eta > 1}, the distribution favors
samples with large determinants. When \deqn{\eta < 1}, the distribution favors samples with small
determinants.
