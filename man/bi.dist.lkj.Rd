\title{Samples from an LKJ (Lewandowski, Kurowicka, Joe) distribution for correlation matrices.}
\usage{
bi.dist.lkj(
  dimension,
  concentration = 1,
  sample_method = "onion",
  validate_args = py_none(),
  name = "x",
  obs = py_none(),
  mask = py_none(),
  sample = FALSE,
  seed = 0,
  shape = c(),
  event = 0,
  create_obj = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dimension}{An integer representing the dimension of the correlation matrices.}

\item{concentration}{A numeric vector representing the concentration/shape parameter of the distribution (often referred to as eta). Must be positive.}

\item{mask}{An optional boolean vector to mask observations.}

\item{shape}{A numeric vector used for shaping. When `sample=False` (model building), this is used
with `.expand(shape)` to set the distribution's batch shape. When `sample=True` (direct sampling),
this is used as `sample_shape` to draw a raw JAX array of the given shape.}

\item{event}{An integer representing the number of batch dimensions to reinterpret as event dimensions (used in model building).}

\item{create_obj}{A logical value. If `TRUE`, returns the raw BI distribution object instead of creating a sample site.}
}
\value{
- When \code{sample=FALSE}: A BI LKJ distribution object (for model building).

   - When \code{sample=TRUE}: A JAX array of samples drawn from the LKJ distribution (for direct sampling).

   - When \code{create_obj=TRUE}: The raw BI distribution object (for advanced use cases).
}
\description{
The LKJ distribution is controlled by the concentration parameter \eqn{\eta} to make the
probability of the correlation matrix \eqn{M} proportional to \eqn{\det(M)^{\eta - 1}}.
When \eqn{\eta = 1}, the distribution is uniform over correlation matrices.
When \eqn{\eta > 1}, the distribution favors samples with large determinants.
When \eqn{\eta < 1}, the distribution favors samples with small determinants.

\deqn{ P(M) \propto |\det(M)|^{\eta - 1}}
