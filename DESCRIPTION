Description: Beta version of 'Bayesian Inference' (BI) using 'python' and BI. It aims to unify the modeling experience by providing an intuitive model-building syntax together with the flexibility of low-level abstraction coding. It also includes pre-built functions for high-level abstraction and supports hardware-accelerated computation for improved scalability, including parallelization, vectorization, and execution on CPU, GPU, or TPU.
