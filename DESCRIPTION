Description: Pre-alpha version of 'Bayesian Inference' ('BI') using 'python' and 'BI'. 
It aims to unify the modeling experience by providing an intuitive model-building syntax 
together with the flexibility of low-level abstraction coding. It also includes pre-built 
functions for high-level abstraction and supports hardware-accelerated computation for 
improved scalability, including parallelization, vectorization, and execution on CPU, GPU, or TPU.
